# FullAdder
This is fulladder .
A full adder is a combinational digital circuit in electronics and digital logic design that is used to add two binary numbers together, producing both the sum and carry-out as output. It is a fundamental building block for performing binary addition in computer arithmetic and is commonly used in the design of microprocessors and other digital devices. A full adder takes three binary inputs: A, B, and a carry-in (Cin) and generates two outputs: the sum (S) and the carry-out (Cout).
